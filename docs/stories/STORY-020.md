## Description
As a data analyst, I want to perform unified search across all usage data with advanced filtering and pagination capabilities, so that I can efficiently find specific events and analyze large datasets without performance issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Unified Search Interface**
   - Given I am on the Event Explorer page
   - When I use the search functionality
   - Then I should be able to search across all event data using a single interface
   - And the search should support text queries, date ranges, and company filters
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: DataTable component with integrated search input

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Given I am performing a search
   - When I apply filters
   - Then I should be able to filter by:
     - Date range (startDate, endDate)
     - Single company or multiple companies (comma-separated)
     - Event types
     - Text search query
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: AdvancedFilters component with date pickers and company multi-select

3. **Pagination Support**
   - Given I am viewing search results
   - When there are many results
   - Then I should see pagination controls with:
     - Current page number
     - Total pages
     - Page size selection
     - Navigation buttons (next/previous)
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Pagination component with navigation controls

4. **Search Results Display**
   - Given I have performed a search
   - When results are returned
   - Then I should see:
     - Paginated list of events
     - Pagination information (current page, total pages, total items)
     - Navigation controls (hasNext, hasPrev)
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: DataTable with pagination info and navigation

5. **Flexible Company Filtering**
   - Given I am filtering by companies
   - When I select companies
   - Then I should be able to:
     - Filter by a single company using the "company" parameter
     - Filter by multiple companies using the "companies" parameter (comma-separated)
     - See results for all selected companies
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Company multi-select with individual and bulk selection

6. **Real-time Search Updates**
   - Given I am viewing search results
   - When I change search criteria or filters
   - Then the results should update automatically
   - And the pagination should reset to page 1
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: useEventExplorer hook with real-time updates

7. **Search Performance**
   - Given I am searching large datasets
   - When I perform searches
   - Then the response time should be acceptable (under 2 seconds)
   - And the system should handle pagination efficiently
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Optimized API calls and loading states

8. **Empty Results Handling**
   - Given I perform a search with no matching results
   - When no results are found
   - Then I should see an appropriate message
   - And the pagination should show 0 total items
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Empty state handling in DataTable component

9. **Search Input Design**
   - Given I am using the search functionality
   - When I interact with the search input
   - Then I should see a well-designed search field with:
     - Search icon
     - Clear button when text is entered
     - Placeholder text for guidance
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Search input with icons and clear functionality

10. **Data Table Features**
    - Given I am viewing search results
    - When I see the data table
    - Then I should see:
      - Company, User, Endpoint, Timestamp, and Value columns
      - Formatted timestamps
      - Responsive table design
      - Loading skeletons during data fetch
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Complete DataTable component with all features

## Status
IMPLEMENTED

## Technical Tasks

### Frontend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Create unified search interface component (DataTable with search input)
2. ✅ Implement advanced filtering controls (AdvancedFilters component)
3. ✅ Add pagination component with navigation (Pagination component)
4. ✅ Create search results display component (DataTable with results)
5. ✅ Implement real-time search updates (useEventExplorer hook)
6. ✅ Add loading states for search operations (Skeleton loading)
7. ✅ Create empty results handling (Empty state in DataTable)
8. ✅ Integrate with `/api/v1/events` endpoint (eventExplorerService)

### Backend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Ensure `/api/v1/events` endpoint supports unified search
2. ✅ Implement advanced filtering logic (Search and filter functionality)
3. ✅ Add pagination support with proper metadata (Pagination info)
4. ✅ Optimize search performance for large datasets
5. ✅ Add validation for search parameters
6. ✅ Implement flexible company filtering (Single and multiple companies)
7. ✅ Add error handling for search operations
8. ✅ Create search result aggregation (SearchResponse model)

## Implementation Notes
- This feature combines search, filtering, and pagination in a single endpoint
- The `/api/v1/events` endpoint handles all search and filtering operations
- Supports both single and multiple company filtering
- Pagination includes comprehensive metadata for UI controls
- Search performance is optimized for large datasets
- All search functionality is already implemented in the backend
