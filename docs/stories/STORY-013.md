## Description
As a system administrator, I want in-memory data storage, so that processed data is available for fast access during runtime.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Data Storage Initialization**
   - Given transformed data is available
   - When data is stored in memory
   - Then it should be accessible for analytics queries

2. **Data Structure Organization**
   - Given processed data is stored in memory
   - When the data is organized
   - Then it should be stored in efficient data structures:
     - Events in a slice for sequential access
     - Companies in a map for fast lookup
     - Indexes for quick filtering

3. **Thread-Safe Access**
   - Given multiple components need to access the data
   - When concurrent access occurs
   - Then data access should be thread-safe using mutex locks

4. **Data Retrieval Performance**
   - Given data is stored in memory
   - When queries are executed
   - Then data should be retrieved within 100ms for typical queries

5. **Memory Management**
   - Given a large dataset is loaded
   - When the application runs
   - Then memory usage should be optimized and monitored

6. **Data Persistence During Runtime**
   - Given data is loaded into memory
   - When the application is running
   - Then data should persist throughout the application lifecycle

7. **Data Access Methods**
   - Given data is stored in memory
   - When different access patterns are needed
   - Then the following methods should be available:
     - Get all events
     - Get events by company
     - Get events by date range
     - Get events by type

8. **Data Consistency**
   - Given data is stored in memory
   - When data is accessed from multiple components
   - Then all components should see consistent data

9. **Memory Cleanup**
   - Given the application is shutting down
   - When the application terminates
   - Then memory should be properly released

10. **Data Validation in Storage**
    - Given data is stored in memory
    - When data is accessed
    - Then the data should maintain its integrity and structure

## Dependencies
- EPIC-004: Data Processing and Integration
- STORY-011: CSV Data Ingestion
- STORY-012: Data Transformation and Validation
