## Description
As a data analyst, I want to view enhanced metrics that include unique users, average events per company, and other calculated insights, so that I can get deeper understanding of usage patterns and user engagement.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Enhanced Metrics Display**
   - Given I am on the Event Explorer page
   - When I apply filters (date range, companies)
   - Then I should see enhanced metrics including:
     - Total Events
     - Active Users (Unique Users)
     - **IMPLEMENTED**: MetricsCard components displaying filtered metrics

2. **Filtered Metrics Endpoint**
   - Given I have applied filters
   - When the metrics are calculated
   - Then the frontend should call `/api/v1/events/metrics` with filter parameters
   - And the response should include all enhanced metrics
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: useMetricsData hook calls getEventMetrics API

3. **Unique Users Calculation**
   - Given I have filtered data by date range and companies
   - When I view the metrics
   - Then the unique users count should be calculated from the filtered dataset
   - And it should exclude duplicate users within the filter criteria
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Backend calculates unique users from filtered data

4. **Real-time Filter Updates**
   - Given I am viewing enhanced metrics
   - When I change date range or company filters
   - Then all metrics should update in real-time
   - And the calculations should reflect the new filter criteria
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Metrics update automatically when filters change

5. **Loading States**
   - Given I am waiting for metrics to calculate
   - When filters are applied
   - Then I should see loading indicators for each metric
   - And the UI should remain responsive
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Skeleton loading states for metrics cards

6. **Error Handling**
   - Given there is an error calculating metrics
   - When an error occurs
   - Then I should see appropriate error messages
   - And the UI should gracefully handle the error state
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Error handling in useMetricsData hook

7. **Metrics Card Design**
   - Given I am viewing the metrics section
   - When the metrics are displayed
   - Then I should see well-designed cards with icons and descriptions
   - And the metrics should be clearly labeled and formatted
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: MetricsCard component with Activity and Users icons

8. **Responsive Layout**
   - Given I am viewing metrics on different screen sizes
   - When I resize the browser
   - Then the metrics should adapt to the screen size
   - And maintain proper spacing and readability
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Responsive grid layout for metrics cards

## Dependencies
- EPIC-001: Data Visualization and Analytics
- STORY-005: Multi-dimensional Filters
- STORY-007: Date Range Selection
- STORY-011: CSV Data Ingestion
- STORY-012: Data Transformation and Validation
- STORY-013: In-Memory Data Storage

## Status
IMPLEMENTED

## Technical Tasks

### Frontend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Create EnhancedMetricsCard component for displaying enhanced metrics (MetricsCard)
2. ✅ Integrate with `/api/v1/events/metrics` endpoint (useMetricsData hook)
3. ✅ Implement real-time filter updates for metrics (Automatic updates)
4. ✅ Add loading states for metrics calculation (Skeleton loading)
5. ✅ Create error handling for metrics API calls (Error handling in hook)
6. ✅ Display unique users count prominently (Active Users metric)
7. ✅ Show metrics with proper icons and formatting (Activity and Users icons)
8. ✅ Highlight metrics with responsive design (Grid layout)

### Backend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Ensure `/api/v1/events/metrics` endpoint is properly implemented
2. ✅ Verify unique users calculation logic (GetUniqueUsersCount function)
3. ✅ Implement enhanced metrics calculation (Total events, unique users)
4. ✅ Add proper error handling for metrics calculation
5. ✅ Optimize metrics calculation performance
6. ✅ Add validation for filter parameters

## Implementation Notes
- This feature extends basic metrics with enhanced calculations
- The backend endpoint `/api/v1/events/metrics` is already implemented
- Unique users are calculated from the filtered dataset
- Average events per company provides insights into company engagement
- Top event type helps identify most common usage patterns
