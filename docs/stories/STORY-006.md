## Description
As an internal teammate, I want to search for usage events using freeform text, so that I can find specific usage patterns or keywords.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Search Input Field**
   - Given I am on the search page
   - When I view the search interface
   - Then I should see a prominent search input field with placeholder text

2. **Basic Text Search**
   - Given I am on the search page
   - When I enter search terms like "export" or "onboarding"
   - Then I should see relevant usage events matching those terms

3. **Search Results Display**
   - Given I have performed a search
   - When results are returned
   - Then I should see a list of matching events with:
     - Event ID
     - Timestamp
     - Company ID
     - Event type
     - Content preview
     - Relevance score

4. **Search Result Highlighting**
   - Given I have performed a search
   - When I view the search results
   - Then matching terms should be highlighted in the content

5. **Search Filters**
   - Given I am viewing search results
   - When I apply additional filters (date range, company, event type)
   - Then the search results should be filtered accordingly

6. **Search Pagination**
   - Given I have many search results
   - When I view the results page
   - Then I should see pagination controls to navigate through results

7. **Search Performance**
   - Given I enter a search query
   - When I submit the search
   - Then results should be returned within 2 seconds

8. **Empty Search Results**
   - Given I search for terms that don't exist in the data
   - When the search completes
   - Then I should see an appropriate message indicating no results found

9. **Search Suggestions**
   - Given I am typing in the search field
   - When I type partial terms
   - Then I should see suggestions for common search terms

10. **Search History**
    - Given I have performed previous searches
    - When I click on the search field
    - Then I should see a list of recent search terms
