## Description
As a data analyst, I want to analyze user retention patterns through cohort-based retention curves, so that I can understand how user engagement changes over time and identify factors that influence user retention across different companies and time periods.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. **Cohort Definition and Data Processing**
   - Given I have user activity data from the dataset
   - When I analyze the data by user cohorts
   - Then I should be able to group users by their first activity date (cohort start date)
   - And each cohort should contain users who started using the system in the same time period
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Backend data processing to extract user cohorts from activity data

### 2. **Retention Calculation Engine**
   - Given I have defined user cohorts
   - When I calculate retention metrics
   - Then I should be able to determine what percentage of users from each cohort remain active after 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days
   - And the calculation should account for users who have multiple activities within the retention period
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Retention calculation logic in backend service

### 3. **API Endpoint for Retention Data**
   - Given I want to retrieve retention analytics
   - When I call GET /api/v1/analytics/retention
   - Then I should receive JSON data containing cohort information and retention rates
   - And the API should support filtering by company, date range, and cohort size
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: RESTful API endpoint with query parameters

### 4. **Retention Curve Visualization**
   - Given I have retention data from the API
   - When I view the Retention page
   - Then I should see a line chart showing retention curves for different cohorts
   - And each cohort should be represented by a different colored line
   - And the chart should show retention rates on the Y-axis and days on the X-axis
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Recharts LineChart component with multiple cohort lines

### 5. **Interactive Chart Features**
   - Given I am viewing the retention curve chart
   - When I hover over data points
   - Then I should see tooltips with cohort information and retention percentages
   - And I should be able to toggle visibility of specific cohorts by clicking on legend items
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Interactive tooltips and legend controls

### 6. **Cohort Filtering and Controls**
   - Given I want to analyze specific cohorts
   - When I use the filtering controls
   - Then I should be able to select specific companies, date ranges, and cohort periods
   - And the chart should update to show only the selected cohorts
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Advanced filtering component with company and date range selection

### 7. **Retention Metrics Summary**
   - Given I am viewing retention analytics
   - When I see the summary section
   - Then I should see key metrics like average retention rates, best performing cohorts, and overall retention trends
   - And the metrics should be clearly displayed with appropriate formatting
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Metrics cards showing key retention statistics

### 8. **Data Export Functionality**
   - Given I have generated retention analytics
   - When I want to export the data
   - Then I should be able to download retention data in CSV or JSON format
   - And the exported data should include cohort details and retention rates
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Export functionality for retention data

### 9. **Empty State and Error Handling**
   - Given there is insufficient data for retention analysis
   - When I view the retention page
   - Then I should see a clear message explaining why retention data cannot be calculated
   - And the system should handle edge cases gracefully
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Proper error handling and empty state messages

### 10. **Performance Optimization**
   - Given I have large amounts of user activity data
   - When I request retention analytics
   - Then the API should respond within reasonable time limits
   - And the frontend should show loading states during data processing
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Optimized data processing and loading states

## Status
IMPLEMENTED

## Technical Tasks

### Backend Tasks
1. ✅ Create retention calculation service (DataService)
2. ✅ Implement cohort grouping logic
3. ✅ Build retention rate calculation algorithm
4. ✅ Create GET /api/v1/analytics/retention endpoint
5. ✅ Add query parameter support (company, date range, cohort period)
6. ✅ Implement data validation and error handling
7. ✅ Add performance optimization for large datasets

### Frontend Tasks
1. ✅ Create RetentionPage component
2. ✅ Build RetentionCurveChart component using Recharts
3. ✅ Implement cohort filtering controls
4. ✅ Add retention metrics summary cards
5. ✅ Create retention data service (API integration)
6. ✅ Add export functionality for retention data
7. ✅ Implement loading states and error handling
8. ✅ Add responsive design for mobile devices

## Implementation Notes
- This feature extends the existing analytics capabilities with cohort-based retention analysis
- Uses the existing user activity data from the dataset
- Implements both backend calculation engine and frontend visualization
- Supports multi-company analysis and comparison
- Provides actionable insights for user engagement optimization
