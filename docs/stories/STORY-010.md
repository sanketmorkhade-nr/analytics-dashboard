## Description
As an internal teammate, I want to export data in various formats, so that I can share insights with stakeholders or perform further analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Export Button Display**
   - Given I am viewing filtered data
   - When I view the dashboard
   - Then I should see an export button in the toolbar

2. **CSV Export**
   - Given I am viewing filtered data
   - When I click the export button and select CSV format
   - Then I should be able to download data in CSV format

3. **JSON Export**
   - Given I am viewing filtered data
   - When I click the export button and select JSON format
   - Then I should be able to download data in JSON format

4. **Export Data Completeness**
   - Given I have applied filters to the dashboard
   - When I export the data
   - Then the exported file should contain only the filtered data

5. **Export File Naming**
   - Given I am exporting data
   - When the file is downloaded
   - Then the filename should include the current date and data type

6. **Export Progress Indicator**
   - Given I am exporting a large dataset
   - When the export is processing
   - Then I should see a progress indicator

7. **Export Error Handling**
   - Given there is an error during export
   - When the error occurs
   - Then I should see an appropriate error message

8. **Export Format Selection**
   - Given I am clicking the export button
   - When I view the export options
   - Then I should see options for CSV and JSON formats

9. **Export Data Validation**
   - Given I have exported data
   - When I open the exported file
   - Then the data should be properly formatted and complete

10. **Export Performance**
    - Given I am exporting data
    - When I initiate the export
    - Then the export should complete within 5 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 records
