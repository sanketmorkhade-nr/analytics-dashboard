## Description
As a data analyst, I want to view usage trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly) through interactive Recharts visualizations, so that I can understand how customer usage patterns change and identify peak usage periods.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Time Period Selection**
   - Given I am on the dashboard page
   - When I select a time period (daily/weekly/monthly) from the shadcn/ui Select component
   - Then the frontend sends a request to `/api/v1/trends` with timeframe filter, and the Recharts LineChart re-renders to show usage trends over that period

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Given I have selected a time period
   - When the dashboard loads
   - Then I should see a Recharts LineChart with:
     - X-axis showing time intervals (days/weeks/months) using Recharts XAxis
     - Y-axis showing event count using Recharts YAxis
     - Data points representing usage volume for each interval using Recharts Line component

3. **Multiple Event Types**
   - Given I am viewing the trends chart
   - When there are multiple event types in the data
   - Then I should see different colored lines for each event type using Recharts Line components with distinct stroke colors

4. **Empty State Handling**
   - Given there is no data for the selected time period
   - When I view the trends chart
   - Then I should see an appropriate message indicating no data is available

5. **Data Accuracy**
   - Given I select a specific time period
   - When I view the trends data
   - Then the event counts should match the actual data in the CSV file for that period

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Given I am viewing the trends chart on different screen sizes
   - When I resize the browser or switch devices
   - Then the chart should remain readable and properly scaled
