## Description
As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically enrich raw CSV data with extracted company names, user information, and endpoint details, so that I can get more meaningful insights from the usage data without manual data processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Company Name Extraction**
   - Given raw CSV data is loaded
   - When the data processing occurs
   - Then company names should be automatically extracted from the content field
   - And the extracted names should be stored in a dedicated field
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: extractCompanyName function processes content field

2. **User Information Extraction**
   - Given raw CSV data is loaded
   - When the data processing occurs
   - Then user information should be extracted from the content field
   - And the extracted user data should be stored in a dedicated field
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: extractUserAndEndpoint function extracts user data

3. **Endpoint Information Extraction**
   - Given raw CSV data is loaded
   - When the data processing occurs
   - Then API endpoint information should be extracted from the content field
   - And the extracted endpoint data should be stored in a dedicated field
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: extractUserAndEndpoint function extracts endpoint data

4. **Data Enhancement Process**
   - Given the system loads CSV data
   - When data enrichment is performed
   - Then the enhanceEvents function should process all events
   - And each event should have enriched fields populated
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: enhanceEvents function enriches all event data

5. **Content Field Parsing**
   - Given a content field contains multiple pieces of information
   - When the parsing occurs
   - Then the extractUserAndEndpoint function should separate user and endpoint data
   - And both pieces should be correctly identified and stored
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Content field parsing separates user and endpoint information

6. **Fallback Handling**
   - Given content field parsing fails for some records
   - When enrichment is performed
   - Then the system should gracefully handle parsing errors
   - And continue processing other records without interruption
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Error handling in data processing pipeline

7. **Data Quality Validation**
   - Given enriched data is created
   - When the data is used in analytics
   - Then the enriched fields should be validated for accuracy
   - And any anomalies should be logged for review
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Data validation during processing

8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Given large datasets are processed
   - When enrichment is performed
   - Then the process should be efficient and not impact system performance
   - And memory usage should be optimized
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Optimized data processing with batch operations

9. **Frontend Data Display**
   - Given enriched data is available
   - When the frontend displays event data
   - Then it should show the enriched fields (Company, User, Endpoint)
   - And the data should be properly formatted for display
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: DataTable component displays enriched fields

10. **Data Structure Enhancement**
    - Given the UsageEvent model is used
    - When events are processed
    - Then the model should include enriched fields:
      - CompanyName (extracted from content)
      - User (extracted from content)
      - Endpoint (extracted from content)
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: UsageEvent model includes enriched fields

## Dependencies
- EPIC-004: Data Processing and Integration
- STORY-011: CSV Data Ingestion
- STORY-012: Data Transformation and Validation
- STORY-013: In-Memory Data Storage

## Status
IMPLEMENTED

## Technical Tasks

### Backend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Implement extractCompanyName function for company name extraction
2. ✅ Implement extractUserAndEndpoint function for user and endpoint parsing
3. ✅ Create enhanceEvents function for bulk data enrichment
4. ✅ Add data validation for enriched fields
5. ✅ Implement error handling for parsing failures
6. ✅ Optimize enrichment process for performance
7. ✅ Add logging for enrichment process
8. ✅ Create data quality metrics for enriched data

### Data Processing Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Integrate enrichment functions into data loading pipeline
2. ✅ Add validation for enriched data quality
3. ✅ Implement fallback mechanisms for parsing errors
4. ✅ Create monitoring for enrichment process
5. ✅ Add performance metrics for enrichment operations

### Frontend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Display enriched data in DataTable component
2. ✅ Show Company, User, and Endpoint columns
3. ✅ Format enriched data for proper display
4. ✅ Handle enriched data in search and filtering
5. ✅ Integrate enriched fields in analytics

## Implementation Notes
- This feature enhances raw CSV data with meaningful extracted information
- Company names are extracted using pattern matching from content field
- User and endpoint information are parsed from structured content
- The enrichment process runs during initial data loading
- Enriched data improves analytics and filtering capabilities
- All enrichment functions are already implemented in the backend
