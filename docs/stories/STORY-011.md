## Description
As a system administrator, I want CSV data ingestion at startup, so that the application can load usage data from local CSV files.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **CSV File Detection**
   - Given a CSV file is available in the application directory
   - When the application starts
   - Then the system should automatically detect and load the CSV file

2. **CSV File Reading**
   - Given a valid CSV file is present
   - When the application starts
   - Then the CSV file should be read without errors

3. **Header Row Handling**
   - Given the CSV file contains a header row
   - When the file is processed
   - Then the header row should be skipped and not included in the data

4. **Data Row Processing**
   - Given the CSV file contains data rows
   - When the file is processed
   - Then each row should be parsed into a structured data object

5. **Error Handling for Missing File**
   - Given no CSV file is available
   - When the application starts
   - Then the application should display an appropriate error message

6. **Error Handling for Invalid CSV**
   - Given the CSV file is malformed
   - When the application tries to read it
   - Then the application should handle the error gracefully and continue

7. **Loading Progress**
   - Given a large CSV file is being processed
   - When the file is loading
   - Then the application should show a loading indicator

8. **Data Validation**
   - Given the CSV file contains invalid data
   - When the file is processed
   - Then invalid rows should be skipped and logged

9. **Memory Management**
   - Given a large CSV file is loaded
   - When the data is stored in memory
   - Then the application should handle memory efficiently

10. **Startup Performance**
    - Given a CSV file with up to 10,000 records
    - When the application starts
    - Then the data should be loaded within 5 seconds
