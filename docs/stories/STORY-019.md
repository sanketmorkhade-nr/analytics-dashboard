## Description
As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and status of the analytics dashboard API, so that I can ensure the system is running properly and provide API documentation to developers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Health Check Endpoint**
   - Given the API server is running
   - When I call `GET /health`
   - Then I should receive a JSON response indicating the service status
   - And the response should include status and message fields
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Backend health check endpoint returns service status

2. **API Documentation Endpoint**
   - Given the API server is running
   - When I call `GET /`
   - Then I should receive a JSON response with API information
   - And the response should include version and available endpoints
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Backend root endpoint provides API documentation

3. **Service Status Information**
   - Given I am checking the health endpoint
   - When the service is healthy
   - Then the response should indicate "healthy" status
   - And include a descriptive message about the service
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Health endpoint returns "healthy" status with descriptive message

4. **Endpoint Discovery**
   - Given I am viewing the root endpoint
   - When I access the API documentation
   - Then I should see a list of all available endpoints
   - And each endpoint should be clearly labeled with its purpose
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Root endpoint lists all available API endpoints

5. **Error Status Handling**
   - Given the service encounters an error
   - When the health check is performed
   - Then the health endpoint should still respond
   - And indicate the current status accurately
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Health endpoint handles errors gracefully

6. **API Version Information**
   - Given I am viewing the root endpoint
   - When I access the API information
   - Then I should see the current API version
   - And the version should be clearly displayed
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Root endpoint displays API version information

7. **CORS Configuration**
   - Given the API is accessed from a web browser
   - When requests are made to health and root endpoints
   - Then CORS headers should be properly configured
   - And cross-origin requests should be allowed
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Backend configured with CORS for frontend access

8. **Response Format Consistency**
   - Given I am accessing system endpoints
   - When I receive responses
   - Then the JSON format should be consistent
   - And the structure should be well-defined
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Consistent JSON response format across all endpoints

9. **Frontend Integration**
   - Given the frontend application is running
   - When the application starts
   - Then it should be able to connect to the backend API
   - And all API calls should work without CORS issues
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Frontend successfully integrates with backend APIs

10. **API Service Layer**
    - Given the frontend needs to make API calls
    - When API requests are made
    - Then they should use a centralized service layer
    - And handle errors and responses consistently
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: apiService layer handles all API communication

## Status
IMPLEMENTED

## Technical Tasks

### Backend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Implement health check endpoint (`GET /health`)
2. ✅ Create root endpoint with API documentation (`GET /`)
3. ✅ Add proper CORS configuration for system endpoints
4. ✅ Implement consistent JSON response format
5. ✅ Add API version information
6. ✅ Create endpoint discovery mechanism
7. ✅ Add error handling for system endpoints
8. ✅ Implement logging for health check requests

### System Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Configure CORS headers for cross-origin access
2. ✅ Add monitoring for health check endpoint usage
3. ✅ Create system status monitoring
4. ✅ Implement API documentation generation
5. ✅ Add version management for API endpoints

### Frontend Tasks (IMPLEMENTED)
1. ✅ Integrate with backend APIs using apiService
2. ✅ Handle CORS configuration for API calls
3. ✅ Implement error handling for API communication
4. ✅ Use centralized service layer for all API calls
5. ✅ Ensure proper API integration across all components

## Implementation Notes
- Health check endpoint provides basic service status monitoring
- Root endpoint serves as API documentation and discovery
- Both endpoints are essential for system monitoring and developer experience
- CORS configuration enables frontend integration
- Response format follows consistent JSON structure
- All system endpoints are already implemented in the backend
