## Description
As a system administrator, I want data transformation and validation, so that CSV data is converted to structured JSON format.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Data Structure Conversion**
   - Given raw CSV data is loaded
   - When transformation occurs
   - Then data should be converted to structured JSON format

2. **Field Mapping**
   - Given CSV data with specific column names
   - When transformation occurs
   - Then CSV columns should be mapped to appropriate JSON fields:
     - id → id
     - created_at → created_at
     - company_id → company_id
     - type → type
     - content → content
     - attribute → attribute
     - updated_at → updated_at
     - original_timestamp → original_timestamp
     - value → value

3. **Data Type Validation**
   - Given CSV data with various data types
   - When transformation occurs
   - Then data types should be validated and converted:
     - String fields should remain as strings
     - Date fields should be parsed as timestamps
     - Numeric fields should be parsed as numbers
     - Null values should be handled appropriately

4. **Required Field Validation**
   - Given CSV data with missing required fields
   - When transformation occurs
   - Then rows with missing required fields should be flagged or skipped

5. **Date Format Validation**
   - Given CSV data with date fields
   - When transformation occurs
   - Then date fields should be parsed and validated for correct format

6. **Data Cleaning**
   - Given CSV data with extra whitespace or special characters
   - When transformation occurs
   - Then data should be cleaned and normalized

7. **Error Logging**
   - Given transformation errors occur
   - When errors are encountered
   - Then errors should be logged with details for debugging

8. **Transformation Performance**
   - Given a dataset with up to 10,000 records
   - When transformation occurs
   - Then the transformation should complete within 3 seconds

9. **Data Integrity**
   - Given transformed data
   - When the transformation is complete
   - Then the data should maintain integrity and consistency

10. **Validation Summary**
    - Given data transformation is complete
    - When the process finishes
    - Then a summary should be provided showing:
      - Total records processed
      - Records successfully transformed
      - Records with errors
      - Validation warnings
