## Description
As a data analyst, I want to explore detailed analytics with drill-down capabilities, so that I can perform deep analysis of usage patterns and identify specific insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Advanced Data Table**
   - Given I am on the detailed analytics page
   - When I view the data table
   - Then I should see a shadcn/ui Table component with:
     - Pagination controls
     - Column sorting functionality
     - Search integration with `/api/v1/events/search`

2. **Company Analytics Drill-Down**
   - Given I am viewing company analytics
   - When I click on a company
   - Then I should see detailed breakdown of that company's usage patterns

3. **Event Type Analytics**
   - Given I am viewing event type analytics
   - When I select an event type
   - Then I should see detailed breakdown of that event type's usage

4. **Time Series Deep Dive**
   - Given I am viewing time series data
   - When I use zoom and pan controls
   - Then I should be able to focus on specific time periods using Recharts

5. **Advanced Search**
   - Given I am using the advanced search
   - When I type in the search field
   - Then I should see search suggestions and results from `/api/v1/events/search`

6. **Data Export**
   - Given I have filtered data
   - When I click the export button
   - Then I should be able to download data in CSV and JSON formats

7. **Interactive Visualizations**
   - Given I am viewing charts
   - When I interact with chart elements
   - Then I should see enhanced interactions and tooltips

8. **Filter Persistence**
   - Given I have applied filters
   - When I navigate between pages
   - Then my filter selections should be preserved
