## Description
As a data analyst, I want to filter data by multiple dimensions (company, event type, date range) using shadcn/ui components, so that I can focus on specific usage patterns and see the filtered results update dynamically in both the data table and charts.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Filter Panel Display**
   - Given I am on the dashboard page
   - When I view the filter section
   - Then I should see filter controls using shadcn/ui components:
     - Date range picker using shadcn/ui DatePicker
     - Company dropdown (multi-select) using shadcn/ui Select with multi-select capability
     - Event type dropdown (multi-select) using shadcn/ui Select with multi-select capability

2. **Date Range Filter**
   - Given I am viewing the filter panel
   - When I select a custom date range using the shadcn/ui DatePicker
   - Then the frontend sends a request to `/api/v1/events/search` with date filters, and all charts and metrics update to reflect that time period

3. **Company Filter**
   - Given I am viewing the filter panel
   - When I select one or more companies using the shadcn/ui Select component
   - Then the frontend sends a request to `/api/v1/events/search` with company filters, and the dashboard shows data only for the selected companies

4. **Event Type Filter**
   - Given I am viewing the filter panel
   - When I select one or more event types
   - Then the dashboard should show data only for the selected event types

5. **Filter Combination**
   - Given I have applied multiple filters
   - When I view the dashboard
   - Then the data should be filtered according to all selected criteria

6. **Filter Reset**
   - Given I have applied filters
   - When I click the "Reset Filters" button
   - Then all filters should be cleared and show all data

7. **Filter Persistence**
   - Given I have applied filters
   - When I navigate away and return to the dashboard
   - Then my filter selections should be preserved

8. **Filter Validation**
   - Given I am setting date filters
   - When I select an end date before the start date
   - Then I should see an error message and the filter should not be applied

9. **Empty Filter Results**
   - Given I have applied filters that result in no data
   - When I view the dashboard
   - Then I should see an appropriate message indicating no data matches the filters

10. **Filter Performance**
    - Given I have applied filters
    - When the dashboard updates
    - Then the filtered results should load within 1 second
